# Kasumi Block Cipher Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Kasumi block cipher**, a lightweight cryptographic algorithm standardized for use in 3GPP mobile communication systems.

## ðŸ“– Overview

**Kasumi** is a block cipher derived from **MISTY1**, designed to provide encryption and integrity in mobile networks. It is primarily used in:

- **A5/3**: For encrypting voice and data in 3G networks
- **f8/f9**: For data confidentiality and integrity protection over UMTS

Kasumi was selected for its balance of performance and security in constrained environments such as mobile devices.
